    Depending on the configuration of a given system, the connection tests can
    hang.

    Tests spin on 32 bit x86 compile with gcc-- longjmp test spins forever.

    CPU_NAME is wrong on earlier (than 10) and later (than 10) versions of
        Solaris (parsing psrinfo output is fragile)

    TimerRes detection on some Solaris 8 SPARC systems is wrong and falsely
        detects resolution as 1nsec

	Check that the number of samples is reasonable

    Fix hang for getpid and cascade_flock tests (probably in barrier code)
