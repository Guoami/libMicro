    .o files should probably be separated from generated binaries (obj-sun4u?)

    Move more of the system info data gathering into tattle

    Would be nice to show the platform name (uname -i) if available

    Multiview's "red" can get a little too bright.

    Consider recoding multiview to use a different performance indicator than
        color (smileys and bombs?)  -- today a 20% perf difference is hard to
        spot (it's very very light pink).

    Add a summary suite runs

    Add ability to compare various tests within a suite?
        e.g.:
            pipe_fmp1   pipe_pmp1   pipe_smp1   pipe_tmp1 
            pipe_fmp4k  pipe_pmp4k  pipe_smp4k  pipe_tmp4k
            pipe_fmt1   pipe_pmt1   pipe_smt1   pipe_tmt1 
            pipe_fmt4k  pipe_pmt4k  pipe_smt4k  pipe_tmt4k
            pipe_fst1   pipe_pst1   pipe_sst1   pipe_tst1 
            pipe_fst4k  pipe_pst4k  pipe_sst4k  pipe_tst4k
    	There are others ...

    Consider testing alternative malloc implementations?

    Add shared vs. private mmap/munmap/mprotect/msync tests?

    Add mutex benchmark tests for the -h switch

    Fold OpenBSD, NetBSD and Android patches for libMicro into the main fold

    Add headers for where /tmp and /var/tmp are mounted
