    .o files should probably be separated from generated binaries (obj-sun4u?)

    Move more of the system info data gathering into tattle

    Would be nice to show the platform name (uname -i) if available

    Multiview's "red" can get a little too bright.

    Add a summary suite run

    Add ability to compare various tests within a suite?
        e.g.:
            pipe_fmp1   pipe_pmp1   pipe_smp1   pipe_tmp1 
            pipe_fmp4k  pipe_pmp4k  pipe_smp4k  pipe_tmp4k
            pipe_fmt1   pipe_pmt1   pipe_smt1   pipe_tmt1 
            pipe_fmt4k  pipe_pmt4k  pipe_smt4k  pipe_tmt4k
            pipe_fst1   pipe_pst1   pipe_sst1   pipe_tst1 
            pipe_fst4k  pipe_pst4k  pipe_sst4k  pipe_tst4k
        There are others ...

    Consider testing alternative malloc implementations?

    Add shared vs. private mmap/munmap/mprotect/msync tests?

    Add mutex benchmark tests for the -h switch

    Fold OpenBSD, NetBSD and Android patches for libMicro into the main fold

    Rename suite templates from .cpp to some other name that does not indicate
    they are c++ files

    Separate out the barrier implementation from the statistics gathering code
    (and data).

    Emit usage information for the given test as part of the test report for
    inclusion in the multiview output.

    Convert the following tests to allow dynamic operation:
        bind
        close
        close_tcp
        connection
        dup
        exit
        fork
        mmap_frag
        mprotect
        munmap_frag
        pthread_create
        socket
        socketpair
